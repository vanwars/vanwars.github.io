          I am an Assistant Professor in the{' '}
          <a href="https://cs.unca.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a> at the
          University of North Carolina Asheville. As an educator, I develop and teach
          courses in human-computer interaction, web development, software engineering,
          introductory programming, and computing and data ethics. As a researcher, I
          design and study educational interventions that aim to broaden participation
          in computing, and help emerging computer scientists recognize and engage with
          the societal and ethical implications of their work. I also build
          computational tools that support civic advocacy and citizen science
          initiatives.

          Prior to joining UNCA, I was an Assistant Professor of Instruction at
          Northwestern University, where I co-directed the TREE Lab with Sepehr Vakil.
          My Ph.D. is from the UC Berkeley{' '}
          <a href="https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/">School of Information</a>, where I
          was advised by Tapan Parikh, and worked with Kris Gutiérrez, Paul Duguid, and
          Coye Cheshire. Before academia, I worked as a software designer/developer,
          building data and communication systems to support public accountability for
          city and regional development projects.
